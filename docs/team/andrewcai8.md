**Enhancements Added**:

- **Task Management Features**
  * Add
    * What it does: Allows users to create standalone tasks with descriptions and due dates.
    * Justification: Financial advisors need to track action items and deadlines independently of clients or policies, providing a comprehensive task management system.
    * Highlights: Implementation was challenging as I had to design the task command structure and ensure proper date validation. The task feature needed to integrate seamlessly with the existing parser and storage architecture.
  * List
    * What it does: Displays all tasks in a formatted, numbered list.
    * Justification: Users need a high-level overview of all tasks to manage their workload effectively.
    * Highlights: Required implementing consistent formatting with other list features in the application.
  * Delete
    * What it does: Removes tasks from the task list by index.
    * Justification: Users need the ability to remove completed or obsolete tasks.
    * Highlights: Ensured proper error handling for invalid indices and confirmation of successful deletion.

- **Client Todo Features**
  * Add Todo
    * What it does: Creates task items specifically linked to individual clients.
    * Justification: Financial advisors need to track client-specific action items, such as follow-ups or claim submissions.
    * Highlights: This required careful integration with the Client class to maintain the relationship between clients and their to-do items. Implementation was challenging as it needed to work alongside both the general task system and client management.
  * List Todos
    * What it does: Displays all to-do items for a specific client.
    * Justification: Provides a focused view of pending tasks for individual clients, improving workflow efficiency.
    * Highlights: Designed the output format to clearly show task descriptions and due dates in an organized manner.
  * Delete Todo
    * What it does: Removes specific to-do items from a client's task list.
    * Justification: Users need to maintain clean, current task lists for each client.

- **Policy Management Features**
  * Add Policy
    * What it does: Creates new policy records with policy names and descriptions.
    * Justification: Financial advisors need to maintain a centralized list of available policies to assign to clients.
    * Highlights: Implemented validation to prevent duplicate policy entries and ensure data integrity.
  * List Policies
    * What it does: Displays all available policies in the system.
    * Justification: Provides users with a quick reference of all policy options available for assignment to clients.
  * Delete Policy
    * What it does: Removes policies from the system by index.
    * Justification: Allows administrators to maintain an up-to-date policy catalog by removing discontinued policies.

- **Welcome Message**
  * What it does: Displays a formatted welcome message when the application starts.
  * Justification: Improves user experience by providing a clear indication that the application has started successfully and gives users context about the application.
  * Highlights: Designed the message to be informative and aligned with the application's professional tone.

- **Unit Tests**
  * Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all the above features to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
