## Design & implementation
### Architecture
![Figure of High Level Architecure Diagram](./umldiagrams/architecture.png)
Here is a quick Overview of Main Components and how they interact with each other:

#### Main Components of the architecture
`Main` is in charge of the app launch and shut down. 
* At app launch, it initializes all other components.
* At shutdown, it shuts down the other components and invoked the java garbage collector where necessary

The App is consisted of the following four components:
* UI: The UI of the app
* Storage: Holds the Data of the App in Memory
* Parser: Finds the appropriate command and returns it to UI
* Commons: Consists of various classes that interact with other components
* LookUpTable: Consists a Look Up Table of various lists that store data
* Command: The command executer
### LookUpTable Component
API: [LookUpTable](./seedu/duke/container/LookUpTable.java)
![Figure of LookUpTable](./umldiagrams/lookuptable.png "Class Diagram of LookUpTable")
In the LookUptable Component,
* It stores the various lists(ClientList,PolicyList,MeetingList,UserList) that implements the ListContainer Interface.
* Once instantiated, the constructor creates the list objects and stores it as a Hashmap with the appropriate key-value pairs
* The LookUpTable is composed of the lists. If deleted, the list objects will be destroyed

### Client Features

When a command with the prefix "client" is invoked by the user, here is a sequence diagram depicting the overall flow of the program.

## User Stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|
|v2.0|user|find a to-do item by name|locate a to-do without having to go through the entire list|
